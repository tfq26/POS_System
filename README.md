# POS_System
Repository with code for POS system designed by Taufeeq Ali

This project was an introduction fo rme to use the Swing toolkit in java and using multilpe components in java. 

There might be some bugs in there but i am working on this actively.

If there are any questions please let me know!

The idea is that this is based off the self checkout system being used in grocery stores today

This project includes creating windows, importing from a specific user file that can be edited and added onto.

I have provided an example file that can be used for a test run

The project also produces a receipt that is reported as the date followed by receipt.

the card check also uses Luhns algorithim, the real system used to check credit card numbers
